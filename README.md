# ðŸ’± Currency Converter (WPF)

A simple desktop app to convert between currencies, built using **C# and WPF**.

---

## Features

- Convert currency using predefined rates
- Easy-to-use interface
- Input validation
- Example: EUR â†’ BDT

---

## How It Works

The formula used:
```
ConvertedValue = (FromCurrencyRate Ã— Amount) / ToCurrencyRate
```


---

Currently, this Currency Converter application uses static (hardcoded) exchange rates for simplicity and demonstration purposes.

## Next:

Storing and retrieving currency values from a database

Allowing easier updates to exchange rates

Supporting dynamic data loading without modifying source code

This will make the app more flexible, maintainable, and closer to real-world standards.

Stay tuned for the database integration!
